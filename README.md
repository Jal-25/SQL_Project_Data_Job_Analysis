# Introduction

In this project, I embarked on a journey to enhance my skills as an aspiring data analyst by utilizing SQL to analyze job-related data. The project involved working with multiple datasets to uncover insights related to job opportunities, required skills, and company information. By leveraging these datasets, I was able to derive valuable conclusions about the job market.

# Background
Data hails from my [SQL Course](https://lukebarousse.com/sql). It's packed with insights on job titles, salaries, locations, and essential skills.

The project is centered around four key files that contain essential information:
- **Job Details:** This file includes job-related information such as job ID, job title, and job source.
- **Skills Details:** This file outlines skills with their corresponding skill names and IDs.
- **Job-Skill Mapping:** This file establishes a relationship between skill IDs and job IDs, indicating which skills are associated with which jobs.
- **Company Details:** This file contains information about companies, including company ID and company name.

By analyzing these datasets, I aimed to identify trends and insights such as the top-paying jobs, the most demanded skills, and the optimal skills for job seekers.

# Tools I Used 
For this project, I utilized the following tools:
- **SQL:** The backbone of my analysis, allowing me to query the database and unearth critical insights.
- **PostgreSQL:** A powerful relational database management system that allowed me to perform complex queries and analyses on the datasets.
- **Visual Studio Code (VS Code):** An integrated development environment (IDE) that I used for coding and managing my SQL scripts. I also explored various extensions to enhance my productivity and workflow.
- **Git & GitHub:** A platform for version control and collaboration, where I documented my project and shared my findings.
# The Analysis
Each query for this project aimed at investigating specific aspects of the data analyst job market.

Here's how I approached each question:

    salary_year_avg,
    job_posted_date,
    name AS company_name

FROM
    job_postings_fact

LEFT JOIN company_dim ON job_postings_fact.company_id = company_dim.company_id

WHERE
    job_title_short = 'Data Analyst' AND 
    job_location IN ('India', 'Anywhere') AND
    salary_year_avg IS NOT NULL

ORDER BY
    salary_year_avg DESC
    
LIMIT 10
```
